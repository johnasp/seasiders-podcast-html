	<h2><a href="blogpost2.php">Tom Ince - The Low-Down</a></h2>
	<p>Tom Ince (20) signed for Blackpool from Liverpool in the summer of 2011 and in just over a year he has grown with each game he has played and is now one of Blackpool’s key attacking weapons. In his first season he scored 8 goals and made 8 assists in 41 appearances. This season he already has 13 goals, 9 assists in 20 league appearances.</p>

	<h2>Blackpool FC's 11/12 Accounts Reviewed</h2>
	<p>Eagerly-awaited they may have been, but the annual release of accounts for Blackpool Football Club Ltd and Segesta Ltd (the properties side of the club) proved to be a much more low-key affair this time around. Absent from the contents was any mention of huge director remuneration like last year, but if one scratches beneath the surface, there remains a story to be told.</p>

<h2>Another Fine Mess</h2>
<p>This season Karl Oyston admitted that Blackpool have been rudderless which has seen the club leer from crisis to crisis whilst all along carrying with them a contractual time-bomb.  Whether this is a part of the Oyston strategy is hard to fathom, but it is without doubt somewhat of a mess.</p>

<h2>#85 : The £195.30 KO Carrot</h2>
<p>In episode 85 we discussed the totally unexpected away victory and Watford and similarly unexpected home defeat to Peterborough, KO dangles a £195 carrot as the club (quite rightly) slashes season ticket prices for next season, KO explains the cause of the pitch problems and next seasons plans for to fix it, and we run the rule over the relegation run-in as Blackpool have eight games remaining to avoid the dreaded drop.</p>
