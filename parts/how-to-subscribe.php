<h1>How to subscribe to the podcast</h1>
<p>Dictionary.com describes a podcast as: "A Web-based audio broadcast via an RSS feed, accessed by subscription over the Internet." Simply put, a podcast is an on-demand radio show which you can subscribe and listen to on your mobile device (or directly on a computer) through a decicated podcast app, known as a "podcatcher".  You can subscribe to a podcast in two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Through a podcast directory, the most popular being the one found within the iTunes store:</li>
  <li>Add the podcast RSS feed address into your podcatcher app.</li>
  </ol>

<p> <strong>Subscribe via iTunes</strong></p>
<p class="callout"><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/blackpool-fc-podcast-seasiders/id388664312">Seasiders Podcast in iTunes</a></p>

<p> <strong>Subscribe via RSS:</strong></p>
<p class="callout"><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SeasidersPodcast">http://feeds.feedburner.com/SeasidersPodcast</a></p>
<p> If you subscribe to a podcast on a mobile device using a podcatcher app, you can set it so each new episode is automatically downloaded to the device, so you can listen wherever and whenever is convienient to you e.g. in the car, the gym, mowing the lawn, walking the dog, etc.</p>
<p><strong>We strongly recommend you  subscribe to this, and other podcasts, on a smart phone  via a dedicated podcatcher app.  It is the best way to listen to and consume podcasts.</strong></p>
<p>The following will guide you though how to subscribe and listen to podcasts on a variety of mobile platforms:</p>

<section class="ios">
<h3>iOS (iPhone/iPod/iPad)</h3>
<p>There are a couple of ways to subscribe in iOS. Firstly, subscribe directly on your mobile device using a podcatcher (such as Podcasts or Pocketcasts) or secondly, subscribe on a computer which synronises its content  with your mobile device when it is physically connected to the computer, usually with a USB cable.</p>
<h4>1. Podcasts app direct on your iOS device</h4>
<p>Apple has  released its own free dedicated podcatcher app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8">&quot;Podcasts&quot;</a> which has made listening and subscribing to podcasts with an iOS device a piece of cake.  You can now subscribe directly from within the Podcasts app and have each new podcast episode automatically downloaded directly to your device. Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Search for and install the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/podcasts/id525463029?mt=8">Podcasts</a> app from the iTunes store.</li>
  <li>When succussfully installed, open the app, click the search icon and enter the search term  "Seasiders" or "Blackpool FC&quot;.</li>
  <li>Click our cover art logo in the search results and then click the subscribe button. You should then see a listing of all our episodes.</li>
  <li>Click the download button attached to each episode you want to listen to.</li>
  <li>You now have the selected episode(s)  downloaded to your device and are subscribed to receive all future episodes automatically. Hit play to listen!</li>
</ol>
<h4>Other options</h4>
<p>You can also try the <a href="computer">PocketCasts</a> app or the Sticher Radio app  It is a great podcast app although, although we recommend that you use the Podcasts app on iOS as it syncronises all your podcast content with other other Apple devices and is also free. </p>

<h4>2. iTunes on your computer</h4>

<p>You should use this method only for non Wi-Fi enabled iOS devices such as the older iPods.  For any Wi-Fi enabled iOS device, we <strong>highly recommend</strong> you use method 1 above.   </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install iTunes on your computer.</li>
    <li> Search the podcasts directory in the iTunes store for &quot;Seasiders&quot; or &quot;Blackpool FC&quot;.</li>
    <li>Click our logo and click the subscribe button.</li>
    <li>Downloads the episode(s) you want.</li>
    <li>Connect your iOS device to your computer (usually via USB cable).</li>
    <li>Sync the iTunes library from the computer to the iOS device. You can set iTunes to sync automatically or manually, set this to your own personal preference.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 to update future podcast content on your device. </li></ol></section>

<section class="android">
  <h3>Android  </h3>
  <p>You'll need a dedicated podcatcher app  to listen  and subscribe to podcasts on an Android device. Use the following process to subscribe to a podcast on an Android podcatcher app:  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Install a podcatcher app from the Google play store (we recommned PocketCasts, this and others are listed below).</li>
    <li>Search the  app's podcast listings for the podcast you want to subscribe to.<br>
NB - You may or may not find the podcast you were searching for as Android podcatcher app listings are not as comprehensive as iTunes. If you did'nt find what you were looking for jump to step 3, if you did find it, ignore steps 3 and 4.</li>
    <li>If you can't find the podcast you want via searching the app podcast listings, you need to find  the podcasts RSS feed address. This can usually be found at the  podcast's supporting website.  The Seasiders Podcast RSS feed address is: <strong>http://feeds.feedburner.com/SeasidersPodcast</strong></li>
    <li>Search your app for an  &quot;import RSS&quot; option or something similar and then copy and paste the RSS feed in when prompted. Exact details of how to do this vary from app to app but it is usually very straightfoward. </li>
    <li>Click  &quot;subscribe&quot;</li>
    <li>Download the episode(s) you are interested in. Listen and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
  <p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/SeasidersPodcast"></a>Here are a few Android podcatchers we recommend, some paid for, some free with an upgrade path to a premium version and some totally free. </p>
  <h4>PocketCasts 4 - Cost = £2.49 (John's recomendation)</h4>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.shiftyjelly.com/android/pocketcasts">Pocketcasts app</a> is my favorite Android podcatchers and is well worth the measily price tag. It has lots of great features including syncronisation across Android devices, playlists,  allows you to listen to only audio from video podcasts, it has a fantastic user interface with large buttons which is especially important when operating in the car.  It is hands down the best Android podcasting app and costs only £2.49 - it is well worth the money.</p>
  <p>PocketCasts has the most comprehesive podcast listings from any app I have used and and seems to have <em>most</em> of the content you would find in the iTunes store. We found the Seasiders Podcast within the podcast listings which means there was no need to manually enter the RSS feed.  </p>
  <p>Watch a video demo of PocketCasts 4 right here:</p>

  <h4>DoggCatcher - Lite is free to £3.34 for full version</h4>
  <p>Another free podcast player which unlocks more features if you upgrade to the full version.  Probably the second best podcatcher, behind PocketCasts.  Watch a video of full features here:</p>

  <h4 style="margin-top: 24px;">Sticher Radio - Free</h4>
  
<p>An alternative to a dedicated podcatcher app is Stitcher Radio, which along with its live radio function, does a decent job of dealing with podcasts  and allows you to "stich" radio and podcast content together to create a playlist, download it and then listen on the go.  You can for example create a news playlist for your morning commute, a business playlist for in the gym and commute home and a comedy and/or sports playlist for the weekends. The fully featured app is also free to download.</p>
<p>You can also stream the latest in news, sports, talk, and entertainment radio anywhere, on demand. Stitcher is also a great tool to help discover the best of over 15,000+ radio shows, live radio stations and podcasts.</p>

  <h3>Windows Phone</h3>
  <p>The only podcatcher we could find for Windows 8 mobile is called SlapDash Podcasts which you download from the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/slapdash-podcasts/0c62e66a-f2e4-4403-af88-3430a821741e">Windows 8 app store</a>. It is free but runs a few adverts, but is perfectly usable. You can pay a small amount to remove the adverts from the app. Here's a bit of blurb about SlapDash Podcast lifted from the Windows App Store:</p>
  <p>Cloud enabled podcast player for Windows 8. Your subscriptions are stored in the cloud, so you can access them from: the web, your Windows computers, and your Windows Phones. Stream and download your shows so that you don&rsquo;t have to rely on your data connection for playback. Saves the player location so you can stop a show and then pick up right where you left off.
