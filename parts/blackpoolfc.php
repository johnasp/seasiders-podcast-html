<p><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10349" title="blackpool-fc-badge" src="http://seasiderspodcast.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/blackpool-fc-badge-300x300.png" alt="" width="210" height="210" />Blackpool Football Club are an English football club founded in 1887 from the Lancashire seaside town of Blackpool.   The club completed a remarkable rise up all four divisions in nine years, culminating in promotion to the Premier League for the 2010/11 season. The Seasiders hold the record for being the only club in English football to be promoted via all four divisions via the play-offs.</p>
<p>The club&#8217;s home stadium has been Bloomfield Road ever since 1901, and their primary nicknames are the Seasiders, the &#8216;Pool and the Tangerines, the latter in reference to the colour of their home shirts, which is often wrongly recognized for orange. The clubs motto is Progress, and is featured on the club badge. They have a intense local rivalry with Preston North End, and to a lesser extent their East Lancashire rivals, Burnley.</p>
<p>The Seasiders most notable achievement is winning the 1953 FA Cup Final, the so-called &#8220;Matthews Final&#8221;, in which they beat Bolton Wanderers 4-3, overturning a 1-3 deficit in the closing stages of the game. During that post-war period, Blackpool made three Wembley appearances in six years and came close to becoming the League Champions on several occasions. The &#8216;Pool also provided the national teams with numerous players, particularly for England in 1953 when four Blackpool men lined up at Wembley, causing the Daily Mirror to announce that &#8220;Blackpool F.C. are playing Hungary today&#8221;. The Tangerines least successful period occurred in the 1980s, and in 1982-83 they finished 21st in English League football&#8217;s lowest tier, their lowest-ever League position.</p>
<h2>Bloomfield Road</h2>
<p>Home of the Seasiders since 1901 it’s currently a bit of a fortress not many teams get many points at Bloomers but your guaranteed goals! The stadium was totally redeveloped in a ten year project, (It wasn’t meant to take 10 years, it just did), the latest being the South East Corner. The capacity is currently set at 17,338, all seater. Away fans are housed in the East stand, the northern half.</p>
<h2>Getting there</h2>
<p><strong>By Car</strong></p>
<p>An easy journey with Blackpool connected to the motorway network by the M55. You actually don’t need to turn off the motorway, the end of the M55 turns into Yeadon Way which then turns into Seasiders Way where the ground is located.</p>
<p>Next to the ground is one of the biggest car parks in Europe. Its pay and display, make sure you do or you will end up with a parking fine. You’re best driving to the ground and then heading to a pub nearby.</p>

<p><strong>Train</strong></p>
<p>Easy to get to via train too. Blackpool main station, Blackpool North is about a 20 minute walk away. The station is very regularly serviced by trains from Preston which is connected to the main rail network. There is Blackpool South Station which is nearer to the ground but it’s not serviced by many trains so your best getting into the main station.</p>
<p><strong>Air</strong></p>
<p>Blackpool has an airport, but there are no UK internal flights at the time of writing.</p>
<p><strong>Bus</strong></p>
<p>The National Express goes to Blackpool, the station in near to the ground only 10 minutes walk, by station it’s actually a glorified bus stop. Buses from Preston, Manchester, Birmingham are regular but take longer than any train or car.</p>
